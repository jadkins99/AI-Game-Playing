# The Bots

## Frankenplayer
A combination of the other three bots code. It uses the BuyMonsterMove from New_player, the steal monster move from PointsPlayer, and the castle placement strategy from Tony

## New_Player

## PointsPlayer
AI which looks for the highest scored monsters it can buy and then places the monsters evenly across the three castles. The castle-placing strategy is a little broken and is not the smartest, but the buy and steal strategies are decent.
